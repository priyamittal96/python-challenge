There are two parts of this particular python scripting work, PyBank and PyPoll, each with respective folders detailed further below. 

## Technologies
The python scripts were generated using jupyter notebooks to allow for ease of edit, update, and running of various parts of the PyBank and PyPoll scripts. The corresponding scripts were later updated to the main.py files under each respective folder. 

## PyBank
Included in the PyBank folder are the script, resource and analysis for the corresponding project. In this part of the project, the bank data, located in the Resources folder, detailed profits and losses over a series of several months. The python script, in the main.py file, details the method used to analyze the information to determine the length of the data, net changes, average changes between months, and the months where the greatest changes in profits or losses had occurred. 

The corresponding analysis is detailed in a text file under the Analysis folder.

## PyPoll
Included in the PyPoll folder are the script, resource and analysis for the corresponding project. In this part of the project, the election data, located in the Resources folder, detailed the votes allocated to a candidate per country. The python script, in the main.py file, details the method used to analyze the election data to determine the vote count in total and for each candidate, along with the respective percentages and the winner based on the given results.
